Otomado Privacy Policy

1. Introduction

Otomado provides a new experience where users share the “trace of human activity” and connect with people around the world. In this App, users can share ambient and everyday sounds from their surroundings in real time and listen to audio broadcast by other users, thereby creating a space where the presence of people can be felt.

Our development team prioritizes user privacy, promising to limit data collection to the minimum necessary and protect it under a strict management system. This Privacy Policy clearly explains the information collected by the App, its purposes, the methods of data handling, and the rights of users, in order to provide an environment in which users can use the service with confidence.

This Policy is formulated based on the following legal frameworks:
– EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
– California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
– Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI)
– Other data protection laws applicable in the countries/regions where the App is provided

In addition, the App uses Google services such as Firebase and Google AdMob, and information collected through these services is managed in accordance with Google’s Privacy and Security policies (https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy and https://policies.google.com/privacy).

This Privacy Policy will be updated from time to time in accordance with changes in laws or service content. When updated, users will be notified within the App and, if necessary, by other appropriate means.

2. Types and Reasons for Information Collected

The App collects the following information for the purposes of providing and improving the service.

(a) User Authentication Information
The App allows users to sign in for authentication and account identification by one of the following methods:
 • Authentication using an email address and password
 • Authentication using a Google account

Upon successful authentication, the App collects and records only the email address and does not collect the Google account’s name, profile image, or Google UID. Although technically these details can be retrieved when using Google authentication, the App intentionally does not collect or store them, and uses only the information necessary for service provision.

In addition, authentication information is used solely for the purpose of identifying the user account and ensuring secure in-App communication, and is not provided to third parties or used for inappropriate purposes.

(b) Country Information
When sharing audio, the App records the country code selected by the user and displays it to listeners. Although the App may obtain regional information based on the device’s language settings when a user selects a country, only the finally selected country code is sent to the server, and no other location information is collected or stored.

(c) Self-Introduction Text
The App records a self-introduction text that the user optionally enters as profile information. Users may choose not to enter a self-introduction text.

(d) Device Time Zone
When sharing audio, the App automatically obtains the device’s time zone information and uses it to display the broadcaster’s local time to listeners.

(e) Total Streaming and Hearing Time
The App records the total time a user spends streaming and hearing, and uses this information for the user to check their own activity history as well as for service improvement.

(f) Audio Data
For smooth and healthy audio sharing, the App temporarily stores the shared audio data on its server. The retention period is approximately one day, after which the data is automatically deleted.

(g) Inappropriate Audio Report Information
To maintain the health of the service, the App records the number and details of reports regarding inappropriate audio and uses this information to verify any violations of the Terms of Service.

(h) Account Suspension Information
To ensure community safety, the App records the email addresses of accounts that have been suspended.

(i) Inquiry Information
For user support purposes, the App records inquiry details, the time of submission, and the sender’s email address.

(j) App Usage and Crash Information
 • Firebase Analytics: Collected to analyze App usage and user behavior for the purpose of improving the App (only non-personally identifiable data is collected).
 • Firebase Crashlytics: Records information on App crashes and errors to help identify and resolve issues (collects error logs and device information that cause crashes, but does not include data that can personally identify users).

(k) Advertising-Related Information (AdMob)
The App displays advertisements using the Google AdMob ad delivery system. For the optimization and personalization of ads, Google AdMob may collect the following information:
 • Advertising identifier (Advertising ID)
 • Device information (such as OS type, model, IP address, etc.)
 • App usage (such as the number of ad impressions and click history)

For details on advertising-related data, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).
