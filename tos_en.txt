1. Protection of Personal Information
The Operator shall comply with the data protection laws of the user’s country or region and handle the user’s personal information securely. If necessary, sufficient information regarding data collection, use, and provision to third parties will be provided to the user in advance, and the user’s consent will be obtained.

2. Consumer Protection
If a user qualifies as a consumer, the Operator will clearly present the necessary information regarding the service (such as fees, payment terms, and cancellation procedures) and will ensure that the rights to withdraw from or cancel a contract as stipulated by local laws are upheld.

3. Dispute Resolution
In the event of a dispute, the parties will first attempt to resolve it through negotiation. If negotiations fail, users may be able to utilize consumer protection agencies or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures available in their country of residence. Moreover, if any provision of these Terms conflicts with mandatory laws of the user’s country of residence, those mandatory laws shall take precedence.
