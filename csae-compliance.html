  <h1>Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Compliance</h1>

  <p>
    At Otomado, we are committed to providing a safe environment for all users. Our platform strictly prohibits any content or behavior that promotes or depicts child sexual abuse or exploitation (CSAE). We take this issue very seriously and have implemented comprehensive measures to prevent CSAE on our app.
  </p>

  <h2>Prohibited Conduct</h2>
  <p>
    In accordance with our Terms of Service, the following actions are strictly forbidden on Otomado:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharing or broadcasting any content related to child sexual abuse or exploitation.</li>
    <li>Engaging in behavior that endangers the safety of children or promotes abusive activities.</li>
    <li>Any communications or actions that threaten, exploit, or abuse minors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reporting and Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    We encourage our users to report any content or conduct that may be related to CSAE. If you encounter any material that you suspect violates our CSAE policy, please follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the in-app report function available on the audio listening screen or through the in-app contact form.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, contact our support team directly at <a href="mailto:support@otomado.com">support@otomado.com</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Upon receiving a report, our team will promptly investigate the matter. If we confirm that the content involves CSAE, we will take immediate action, which may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removing the offending content.</li>
    <li>Suspending or permanently deleting the account involved.</li>
    <li>Reporting the incident to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We also ensure that the privacy of any reporter is strictly protected.
  </p>

  <h2>Age Verification and User Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    Otomado is designed for users who are 16 years of age or older. A simple age verification process is implemented at the start of app use to ensure compliance with this requirement. If it is determined that a user is under 16, their account will be immediately deleted.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Commitment to Child Protection</h2>
  <p>
    We continuously review and update our policies and procedures to ensure that our platform meets or exceeds legal and international standards for child protection. The safety and well-being of children is our top priority, and we are dedicated to maintaining a CSAE-free environment.
  </p>
