  <h3>Data That May Be Retained:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service Integrity &amp; Legal Obligations:</strong> Some records, such as reports of inappropriate audio, account suspension information, and inquiry histories, may be retained for up to one year (or as required by applicable laws) to ensure community safety, service integrity, and compliance with legal obligations.
    </li>
